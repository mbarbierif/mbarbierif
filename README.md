# Mauricio Barbieri Figueroa

Hi! 👋🏻 My name's Mauricio and I'm a Data Engineer. I was born, raised and trained as a Civil Industrial Engineer in Chile, then love brought me to La Plata, in Argentina, where I'm based today. People are at the center of everything I do, understanding and helping people is what drives me to grow and learn every day. This has led me to participate in the most diverse human spaces, from high school math clubs, LGBT+ religious ministries, social justice movements, professional theatre companies, different choruses, music conservatories and the university experience as an engineering major. When you look closely you realize... the written and spoken word, spirituality, art, science, formal logic and math, programming, among others, are all languages that humanity has created to talk about its experience with life and solve problems, that's why I've felt drawn to them.

Professionally, I have four years of experience in Data Engineering, using Python to build and maintain ETL/ELT pipelines, REST APIs, working with SQL and NoSQL databases to build OLAP cubes, data warehouses, and data lakes. I've also worked with Docker containers, and I've used Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) to create and provision virtual machines in order to build monolithic data architectures. I also hold a MicroMaster degree in Statistics and Data Science from MIT, that I completed while working in 2020. In the following months I'll be diving deep into the full range of GCP and AWS tools for data engineering, Snowflake and dbt, among other relevant technologies.

All of my professional experience has happened in a global context, where I've worked with international teams and clients, on both startups and corporations. I speak English fluently since I was 16, nowadays it's near native. I love to use it on a daily basis even on non-professional settings, this allows me to write high quality documentation, explain complex technical ideas in simple terms and deliver presentations effectively.

I'm currently looking for a new job opportunity in the exciting field of data engineering, hopefully with a Python/GCP-focused tech stack, a truly diverse group of teammates, or a modern organization with a pretty clear mission for social good. I'm very interested in anything related to humane technology, social data science, computational social science, LGBT+ rights and intersectional feminism. I'd be happy to know more about you and your organization, you can email me at mbarbierif@gmail.com or just message me directly on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbarbierif).
